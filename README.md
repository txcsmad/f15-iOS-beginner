# iOS Beginner, Fall 2015
Class materials and projects. Course overview (which will be highly responsive to the class' needs and will likely change) is available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Rhag5U3ojIyiubxnb8T6mIxjxCFUWx-8iT2HKg2Vj28/edit?usp=sharing).

Everything will be indexed by individual workshop. Initial code will be committed to the workshop folder, and then any changes will be commited ontop at the end. Use the commit history to see the changes to the files. The repo will be tagged at the beginning of each session to let you know where we started.
